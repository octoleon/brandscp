  Allows to attach an expense file to the event. The expense file should first be uploaded to Amazon S3 using the
  method described in this article[http://aws.amazon.com/articles/1434]. Once uploaded to S3, the resulting
  URL should be submitted to this method and the expense file will be attached to the event. Because the expense file is
  generated asynchronously, the thumbnails are not inmediately available.

  The format of the URL should be in the form: *https*://s3.amazonaws.com/<bucket_name>/uploads/<folder>/filename where:

  * *bucket_name*: app-stage
  * *folder*: the folder name where the photo was uploaded to

  description <<-EOS
  This method returns all the info required to make a POST to Amazon S3 to upload a new file. The key sent to S3 should start with
  /uploads and has to be created into a new folder with a unique generated name. Ideally using a GUID. Eg:
  /uploads/9afa6775-2c8e-44f8-9cda-280e80446ced/My file.jpg

  The signature will expire 1 hour after it's generated, therefore, it's recommended to not cache these fields for long time.
